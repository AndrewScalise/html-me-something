                    <h2>Pokemon ORAS</h2>
                    <p>Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are remakes of
                        the original Ruby and Sapphire games from the game advance.
                        These games have been heavily renewed to the 3DS system, and feature
                        many things such as more legendary pokemon, and an epilogue that
                        is fantastic to play. Overall another great staple added to the Pokemon
                        empire.
